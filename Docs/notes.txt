Matrix tree theorem directed graphs

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with no paths:
    This is always Z_n.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with one path:
    This is always trivial.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with two paths:
    Possible way of generalization: prove that two paths always use up all
    available higher invariant factors

    Invariant factor depends only on number of zeroes clockwise of the
    counter-clockwise path and counter-clockwise of the clockwise path.
    The other ends of these paths can grow or shrink, and it will not
    change the invariant factor.

    It does also seem to not matter if the inside of this path is broken up be zeroes.
    This means that the inside of these paths can be anything as long as the
    cc paths and the c paths do not cross.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with more than two paths:
    This refers to any configuration that are not covered by the two paths configurations.
    The only factors that I have noticed for these paths is Z_2 and the trivial group.

Wheel graphs:
    Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=2) inv factors followed 2^(size-1)-1 x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=1) inv factors followed size-1 x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=1) inv factors followed size-1 x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=2) inv factors followed 2^(size-1)-1 x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=0) inv factors followed .27555(golden_ratio^{x}) x 5*.27555(golden_ratio^{x}) x Z for odd sizes
    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=0) inv factors followed .618035(golden_ratio^{x}) x .618035(golden_ratio^{x}) x Z for even sizes
